# Embedded C to interface LM35 temperature sensor with LPC1768 ARM Microcontroller to estimate temperature and display it on external LCD using an Analog to Digital converter

HARDWARE COMPONENTS USED

**LPC1768** : 
The LPC1768 is a CortexÂ®-M3 microcontroller for embedded applications featuring a high level 
of integration and low power consumption. The code has been written in Embedded C and tested 
out on an ARM7 Cortex M3 evaluation board.

**LM35 temperature sensor** : 
LM35 is a temperature measuring device having an analog output voltage linearly proportional 
to the temperature. It provides output voltage in Centigrade (Celsius) and does not require any 
external calibration circuitry. The sensitivity of LM35 is 10 mV/degree Celsius.

**Zener Diode** : 
A Zener diode is a heavily doped semiconductor device that is designed to operate in the reverse 
direction.

**Breadboard** : 
A thin plastic board used to hold electronic components (transistors, resistors, chips, etc.) that are 
wired together. Most electronic components in electronic circuits can be interconnected by 
inserting their leads or terminals into the holes and then making connections through wires where 
appropriate.
